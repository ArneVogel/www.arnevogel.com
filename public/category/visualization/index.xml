      <description>While traveling with the Deutsche Bahn I noticed that they broadcast amongst others the speed and the position of the train under this url: https://www.wifi-bahn.de/schedule.jason
This is the result of logging the positions and speeds and plotting them with R&amp;rsquo;s ggmap:
The speed is in m/s, each point is after 30 seconds.
Logging with: bahnlog.py
Plotting with: bahn.Rmd</description>

      <description>Analyzing 41194 comments and 6367099 words posted in Hacker News &amp;ldquo;Who is Hiring&amp;rdquo; threads. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what those threads are here is the latest one: Ask HN: Who is hiring? (December 2017)
In these threads companies can self promote their job offerings and in doing to they describe the jobs they are offering.
In this post I show the most interesting things I found while playing around with the data.</description>
