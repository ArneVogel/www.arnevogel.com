This is something I learned by a PR for listudy.
In my code I had window.onresize = resize_ground; to adjust the size of the chess board when the browser window changed width. But as Sean Yeh in the PR pointed out this caused unintended behavior in mobile browsers. When scrolling down the url bar would hide. As this would trigger a window.</description></item><item><title>TIL: Beamer has Slide Transitions</title><link>https://www.arnevogel.com/til/beamer-slide-transitions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Nov 2022 16:12:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arnevogel.com/til/beamer-slide-transitions/</guid><description>I always just assumed that slide transition animations are limited to WYSIWYG presentation programs. Turns out you can define slide transitions in beamer by default without any special packages.
See Chapter 14.3 of the beamer documentation for all the available transitions and their options.
Some of the transitions seem to be wonky though, with some parts of the slide being hidden or cut off after the transition.</description></item><item><title>TIL: The Nix Home Manager Works on Non-Nix Distros</title><link>https://www.arnevogel.com/til/nix-home-manager-works-on-non-nix-distros/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 16:47:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.arnevogel.com/til/nix-home-manager-works-on-non-nix-distros/</guid><description>Nix in general seems promising for both reproducible software and as a distro. But making a full switch seems like a lot of work and im lazy. Because of this I am happy to find out that the home-manager project works on non-nix distros. Tl:dr on home-manager: it lets you configure and install software on your system using the nix ecosystem. This lets me incrementally switch while staying on my regular distros.</description></item></channel></rss>
